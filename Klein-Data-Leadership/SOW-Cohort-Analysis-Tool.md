# Statement of Work (SOW)
## Project: Cohort Analysis Web Tool Development

**Primary Goal:**  
Build a tool for non-analytically inclined team members, primarily marketing, enabling them to pool monthly cohort data at any time.

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 06-05-2024  
**Prepared by:** Hunter Kleinschmidt, Lead Data Analyst / Project Manager  
**Prepared for:** Klein Training App

## 1. Project Overview

This project involves developing a web-based tool designed to automate cohort analysis for Klein Training. The tool will streamline reporting on payments and subscription statuses by user cohorts, thereby enhancing data-driven decision making. In this project, I served as the Lead Data Analyst and Project Manager, overseeing all aspects of development and management. Taha Amir contributed as the primary intern for this initiative.

## 2. Project Scope

- **Data Extraction:**  
  Adapt and refine pre-existing Python scripts originally developed by Charles and Hunter to extract and convert data from Firebase into CSV format. Address authentication issues, ensure compatibility with downstream processing, and tailor the output to align with project-specific requirements.

- **Data Processing:**  
  Modify the initial structure of R scripts for data cleaning and transformation developed by Kareem. Rework and customize these scripts to generate monthly cohort tables, optimizing them for integration into the web application workflow.

- **Web Application Development:**  
  Design and build an interactive web tool using Flask and HTML/CSS to present cohort analysis results. Develop both backend logic and frontend interfaces, enabling user-friendly data visualizations and on-demand exploration of key metrics.

- **Documentation & Training:**  
  Create comprehensive documentation, including annotated code, setup instructions, user manuals, and training materials to support both technical maintenance and non-technical usage.

- **Project Management:**  
  Lead the project from planning through deployment. Manage timelines, define objectives, coordinate feedback, and ensure delivery of a high-quality, sustainable solution that aligns with organizational goals.

- **Risk and Quality Management:**  
  Identify potential risks and establish mitigation strategies. Implement quality assurance practices through regular code reviews, testing, and stakeholder check-ins. Conduct a post-implementation review to evaluate project success and capture lessons learned.

## 3. Objectives

- Automate the reporting process for user cohorts.
- Enhance data-driven decision making by providing clear, actionable insights.
- Improve internal data workflows and reduce manual reporting efforts.
- Develop a scalable tool that accommodates analyses for different dates and sports parameters.

## 4. Deliverables

- **Data Extraction Scripts:**  
  Python code for fetching and converting Firebase data.

- **Data Processing Scripts:**  
  R code for cleaning, transforming, and generating cohort tables.

- **Web Application:**  
  An interactive tool featuring dashboards and visualizations.

- **Documentation:**  
  Detailed technical specifications, user guides, annotated code, and this SOW document.

- **Training Materials:**  
  Resources to enable team members to operate and maintain the tool.

- **Post-Implementation Report:**  
  A review document capturing lessons learned and project success metrics.
