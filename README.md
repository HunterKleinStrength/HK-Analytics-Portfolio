# Hunter Kleinschmidt's Analytics Portfolio
Hi, I’m Hunter Kleinschmidt, but I prefer to go by Hunter Klein. This is a collection of my data engineering and analysis work from my time at the Klein Training App. As a startup, our team often wears many hats. I never expected to dive so deeply into the data side of the company, but the progression of our product demanded it. My skills are mostly self-taught, aside from an introductory biostats course in college. These projects just scratch the surface of how we’ve managed, processed, and analyzed data at Klein to drive decisions and results, using tools like SQL, Python, R, and Tableau.

Check out my projects below, along with my visualizations on Tableau Public (coming soon).
